									<h3><a href="#">Step 1</a></h3>
									<p>The very first sort of shoe available in the marketplace today is the elegant shoe. It is made of fine leather and contains a strong sole that can step past a stone and still have the same form. They seem thin and sleek and are designed to coincide with the best suites on the market, complementing you features and which makes you seem truly professional. Gucci makes a number of the ideal office shoes ever seen on the marketplace and they utilize only the finest leathers. If you're a business man and you are looking to be as professional as possible and create the best first impression possible, then you are going to need to get yourself some elegant and classy leather shoes.</p>

									<h3><a href="#">Step 2</a></h3>
									<p>The next kind of shoe available on the market is the sports shoe. They are designed for extreme physical effort and have the build to last a few decades. Some of them really look classy and can be worn with a wonderful pair of pants which might not be necessarily hip. What is clear about those sports shoes is they're separated in design by athletic domain names. By way of instance, a set of jogging shoes from Puma, will look completely different from basketball shoes from Nike.</p>

									<h3><a href="#">Step 3</a></h3>
									<p>The previous type of shoe which actually combines the two is represented by male casual shoes. These shoes are made from leather and have the tendency to unite both worlds. They may be worn on a serious occasion in addition to a celebration or a driveway. They're comfortable and can also be designed to last. You can find them mostly in black, brown and white, and all these are the three main colours which are best suited for this type of shoe. In the case that you're wondering around the price range of some casual leather shoes, then the costs go from $50 to $100, depending on manufacturer and model.
